In this GitHub Repository, we delve into the pivotal issue of global warming, with a focus on carbon emissions in supply chains, particularly within the context of a Brazilian company, Olist. Carbon dioxide, Nitrogen Dioxide, and Sulphur Dioxide are identified as significant greenhouse gases, with carbon dioxide being the primary contributor to global warming. Recognizing the urgency of sustainability, businesses increasingly prioritize transparency in their development efforts.

Investors now scrutinize a company's sustainability practices, influencing assessments of its value and adaptability. This project utilizes historical e-commerce data from Olist (2016-2018) to calculate CO2 emissions per order. The formula considers the weight of goods, distance from seller to customer, and emissions factor for transportation mode. Data analysis, cleaning, and visualization, employing Python libraries like Numpy, Matplotlib, Pandas, Seaborn, Plotly, and Geopy, provide insights into emissions contributors. Visualizations, including bar plots, scatter plots, and bubble maps, showcase the environmental impact of products, orders, and cities. Additionally, Tableau is employed to create interactive visualization dashboards. This repository serves as a valuable resource for those interested in understanding and addressing the environmental implications of supply chain operations.
